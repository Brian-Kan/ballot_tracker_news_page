NOTES

When trying to be responsive, the browser seems to stick and I have to refresh it to see it properly.

As mentioned in a previous email, I did have trouble with some of the stylings.

Particularly the partial "ticks" or lines for the border and the "vertical tick" for the "Watch Now" feature.

I also had some minor trouble with the ballot updates.

Mostly everything else seemed to be in place.

I tried to add notes where possible but it was mostly styling various elements to look right.
